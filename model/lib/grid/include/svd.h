/** Least squares fitting via singular value decomposition.

 * With A = U * W * V^T, the solution of 
 *
 * (1) A * x = z 
 *
 * that minimizes the cost function
 *
 * (2) Q = (A * x - z)^T * (A * x - z)
 *
 * (in the least squares sense) is given by 
 *
 * (3) x = (A^T * A)^-1 * A^T * z = V * W^-1 * U^T * z.
 *
 * This solution is used in the case if parameter std == NULL.
 *
 * If the data has known covariance S, the cost function modifies as
 *
 * (4) Q = (A * x - z)^T * S^-1 * (A * x - z),
 *
 * which can be rewritten as
 *
 * (5) Q = (A' * x - z')^T * (A' * x - z'),
 *
 * where 
 *
 * (6) A' = S^(-1/2) * A, z' = S^(-1/2) * z, 
 *
 * so that the solution x that minimizes (4) is given by
 *
 * x = V' * W'^-1 * U'^T * z',
 *
 * where V', W' and U' represent SVD of the modified matrix A': 
 * A' = U' * W' * V'^T.
 *
 * In the case when S is diagonal, (6) is equivalent to dividing i-th row of 
 * the system (1) by S(i,i)^(1/2), or by standard deviation of i-th
 * measurement. This approach is used in the case if parameter std != NULL.
 *
 * @param A Matrix A of the system (1) [0..nj-1][0..ni-1]
 * @param ni Number of columns
 * @param nj Number of rows
 * @param z Right-hand of the system (1) [0..nj-1]
 * @param std Vector of standard deviations for each row [0..nj-1] or NULL
 * @param w Singular values of the modified matrix A' = S^(-1/2) * A [0..nj-1]
 * @param sol Solution of the modified system (1),(4) [0..ni-1]
