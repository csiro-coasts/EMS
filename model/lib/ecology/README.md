# EMS Ecology library

Thie ecology library provides optical and biogeochemical models

The EMS biogeochemical model has been applied throughout Australian estuarine and shelf waters, and in Chilean and Israeli waters.

## Processes available in the library include:
* Resolves carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling
* Multiple phytoplankton types (including Trichodesmium), 2 zooplankton plankton food web
* Spectrally-resolved optical model including calculation of remote-sensing reflectance
* Variable C:Chl processes
* Equilibrium carbon chemistry calculations
* Contains a 3-stage remineralisation / detrital pathway
* Represents seagrass, macroalgae, benthic microalgae and corals
* Mass balance checks for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and oxygen
