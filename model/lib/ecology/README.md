# EMS Ecology library

Thie ecology library provides optical and biogeochemical models

The EMS biogeochemical model has been applied throughout Australian estuarine and shelf waters, and in Chilean and Israeli waters.

## Key features include:
* Resolves carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling
* 4 phytoplankton, 2 zooplankton plankton food web
* Spectrally-resolved optical model including calculation of remote-sensing reflectance
* Contains a 3-stage remineralisation / detrital pathway
* Represents seagrass, macroalgae, benthic microalgae and corals
