# SHOC Hydrodynamic model
**SHOC** (Sparse Hydrodynamic Ocean Code) is a finite difference hydrodynamic model in EMS. This model is intended to be a general purpose model applicable to scales ranging from estuaries to regional ocean domains. Outputs from the model include three dimensional distributions of velocity, temperature, salinity, density, passive tracers, mixing coefficients and sea level. Inputs required by the model include forcing due to wind, atmospheric pressure gradients, surface heat and water fluxes and open boundary conditions (e.g. tides). **SHOC** is based on the three dimensional equations of momentum, continuity and conservation of heat and salt, employing the hydrostatic and Boussinesq assumptions. The equations of motion are discretized on a finite difference stencil corresponding to the Arakawa C grid.

**SHOC** is also one of the 'driver' applications in EMS
