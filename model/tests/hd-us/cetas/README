Process to build an unstructured model.

1. Make a full parameter file (in.prm) using the -ag option. This generates the
mesh using coastmesh and a coastline file. The weighting function is a function
of bathymetry.

compas -ag auto.prm

The mesh may be plotted using the matlab script plot_cetas.m.
The files created using -ag are described in auto_meshfiles.txt.
in.nc may be mouted on THREDDS and visualized with GODIVA3.

2. Edit the in.prm file to include the open boundaries and forcing, then remake
the input file. Such an edited file is provided as cetas.prm, however, note that
this is an example only and the forcing files required to run are not supplied.

rm in.nc
compas -g in.prm in.nc

3. Run the model.

compas -p in.prm
