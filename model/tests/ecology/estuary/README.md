### EMS Ecology test using SHOC : estuary

The domain inludes a river and one open ocean boundary

Horizontal resolution is 1 km on a rectangular grid 

The whole domain is 50 km by 27 km 

Cirulation is simple, with a fresher flow of water from the river and
a constant wind forcing (from inshore).  Tides are also activated
