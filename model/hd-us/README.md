# COMPAS Hydrodynamic model
COMPAS is a finite volume hydrodynmic model for unstructured
grids. It follows the [MPAS-O](https://mpas-dev.github.io/)
framework as described by Ringler et al (2010) and Ringler et
al. (2013).  The framework is grid agnostic as long as it is an
orthogonal mesh. One such grid generator is
[JIGSAW](https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw) which is supplied as
part of the EMS package - [see here](../../ext/jigsaw)

**COMPAS** is also one of the 'driver' applications in EMS
