The files in this directory are custom build phase hooks for the automated dockerhub builder,
and are used to set up custom build configurations and docker registry push options for when
this repository is set up as a DockerHub repository with autobuild enabled.

See <https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/advanced/#custom-build-phase-hooks> for more information about how they work.
